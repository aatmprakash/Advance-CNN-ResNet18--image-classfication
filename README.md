## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and deep learning-based approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This project aims to leverage the power of the ResNet18 architecture to classify images accurately.

The ResNet18 model utilizes residual connections, allowing for the training of deeper networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem. By stacking convolutional layers and residual blocks, the model learns hierarchical representations of the input images, enabling effective classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository. However, the code provided assumes the availability of a labeled image dataset suitable for image classification tasks. It is important to curate a diverse and representative dataset to train the ResNet18 model effectively.

Ensure that the dataset is organized into separate directories for each class, and adjust the code accordingly to load and preprocess the data.

## Model Architecture

The ResNet18 model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by residual blocks. The residual blocks enable the model to learn residual mappings, which are then added to the original feature maps to form a more accurate representation.

The ResNet18 model consists of 18 layers, including convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, activation functions, and a fully connected layer for classification. The model's architecture allows for effective feature extraction and representation, leading to improved image classification accuracy.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aatmprakash/Advance-CNN-ResNet18--image-classfication.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the required dependencies and prepared your dataset accordingly.

To train the ResNet18 model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The model will begin training using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. The trained model checkpoints will be saved for future use.

To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset, run the following command:

```
python evaluate.py --model saved_models/model.pth
```

Replace `model.pth` with the appropriate saved model checkpoint file.

## Results

The evaluation script will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the trained ResNet18 model on the test dataset. These metrics measure the model's ability to correctly classify the images in different classes.

The results obtained from the evaluation can help gauge the effectiveness of the ResNet18 model for image classification tasks and compare its performance with other models or approaches.
